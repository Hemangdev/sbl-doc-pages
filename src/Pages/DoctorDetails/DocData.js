      paraInfo1:'Born in Chandni Chowk area of Old Delhi, on Sharad Purnima Day of the year 1941. The schooling was done in a then reputed school in the neighborhood till Higher Secondary, and followed by Graduation from Deshbandhu College under Delhi University in the year 1962. Took education in Homoeopathic System of Medicine, and passed the D.H.S. Examination of the Delhi Board of Homoeopathic System of Medicine, under Government of Delhi, in the year 1967. Entered the professional practice in that year itself, and later on passed the Post Graduate in Rehabilitation Medicine from All India Institute of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Bombay, in the year 1980.',  
      paraInfo2:'His maternal grandfather was a reputed Homoeopath of his time. In the earlier times, when Homoeopathy was not even recognized, the homoeopaths of that period were students of Dr. Daya Shanker Kayasth, who was a direct student of Dr. J. T. Kent. His maternal grandfather Dr. Rup Narain, and his other colleagues used to conduct self-study, with other colleagues, Dr. Rajender Kumar Bhatnagar (Father of Dr. Balraj K. Bhatnagar, the First Principal of Nehru Homoeopathic Medical College (NHMC), Defence Colony, New Delhi), Dr. Bagchi (Pathologist), & Dr. K. N. Mathur, who was an MBBS, but later on took to Homoeopathy after completing MF(Hom) from London.  He has been lucky that his teachers included Dr. Balraj K. Bhatnagar, Dr. Diwan Harish Chand, Dr. V. D. Kashyap, Dr. P.N. Chopra, Dr. Krishan Khera, Dr. P. C. Sharma, Dr. P. C. Mehta, Dr. S. N. Kashyap, Dr. V. N. Ghai, Dr. Jugal Kishore, Dr. K. N. Mathur and others. All these doctors have always been very supporting in imparting education, and at the same time they were tough examiners. There have been many challenges at that time, as the NHMC was in the process of taking the shape, the initial classes used to be conducted in Kundan Lal Building, at New Rohtak Road, and for the OPD exposure, used to visit their clinics and gain practical exposure. Later on, the classes shifted to the NHMC building, in the area where there is Lunch Room at present. The teacher in Surgery, Dr. Krishan Khera, was very cooperative to give exposure in his OPD at Jessa Ram Hospital, and even allowed him to attend the operation theater. The exposure to the Clinical Laboratory was through a friend who was the Technician at the Municipal Corporation’s Laboratory at Civil Lines, Delhi.',

      parInfo3:'The entry into the profession was not an easy task. Since the official recognition of Homoeopathy was taking the shape, the market value of a Homoeopath was equal, or even less than that of a Lower Division Clerk in the Government, and when giving introduction as a Homoeopath, often there would be queries, “ISKE ALAWA OR KYA KARTE HO?”, or, “What is your other source of income?”, as the general impression was that a whole time Homoeopath cannot run his family. The practical training was under his elder brother, who used to practice (as he has been under training of Dr. Rajender Kumar Bhatnagar), and was also managing the trade at Segal’s Pharmacy, and was legally eligible to get registered under the Delhi Homoeopathic Act, 1956. The other guidance was provided by his host of teachers who always used to encourage. He has always loved challenges in life. The initial challenge was the acceptability of the Diploma in Homeopathic Medicine (D.H.S.) even within homoeopathic fraternity. The main reason was that initially, as the system was on way to proper regulatory mechanism, the initial batches were exempt from appearing in the DHS (Previous) as per regulations of the Delhi Homoeopathic Board. As the NHMC was also in the process of being established for the full DHS Curriculum, the classes used to hold only in the evenings, on week days, and on Sunday mornings. His colleagues during studies included Dr. H. L. Chitkara, and Dr. B. R. Sur, who later founded Dr. B. R. Sur’s Homoeopathic college at Nanakpura (earlier known as Moti Bagh II). The regular morning classes for DHS started from the year 1967, and the first batch to come out of this institution was in the year 1971. Meanwhile, the nomenclature of the Diploma (DHS) was changed to DHMS, and as a result those who were admitted to the DHS, got the final diploma as DHMS. Many students of that time are now well-known figures in our Homoeopathic Fraternity, whether in academics, trade, or Industry. Later on, after the creation of Central Council of Homoeopathy, there was adopted a uniform curriculum throughout India as DHMS, and finally changed to the Degree Course as BHMS, which now is the entry point in Homoeopathic Education.',

      paraInfo4:'The opposition to this qualification (DHS), although all those who passed these examinations had to undergo tough screening by the examiners, was by those, whose names he did not prefer to disclose. Many of his colleagues of that period used to feel upset by these facts, he always encouraged them not to feel disappointed, as all of them had passed after rigorous grilling by the examiners, and they should focus on treating their patients, and also take regular participation in the monthly meetings of the Delhi Homoeopathic Medical Association for keeping themselves updated regarding the education. On getting an opportunity, he joined the certificate course in Post Graduate in Rehabilitation, at the All-India Institute of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at Bombay (as it was known at that time) in the year 1980. This institute was established by the Government of India. The other challenges from time to time, whether introducing Drugs & Cosmetics Rules 1945, or the Delhi Intoxicating Spirituous Preparations Rules, or the initial introduction of Central Council for Indian Systems of Medicine, and Homoeopathy, and subsequent proposals in the Central Council of Homoeopathy Bill, he has always actively participated to see that Homoeopathic System of Medicine gets the place at par with the other systems of medicine. His passion for Homoeopathy has increased each day, and now his mission is “Since Homoeopathy has given us Bread and Butter, House to live, and after a long struggle, a respectability to the profession, it becomes our duty to give it back to our new entrants in the profession, encourage, and instill confidence in them to become self-dependent.” His Professional Journey since July 1967 has given him various types of cases, acute as well as chronic. Earlier in his practice, he also used to handle cases of injuries, but later on discontinued it, to avoid any future problem of any Medico-Legal situation. In the earlier years, when the Drugs & Cosmetics Rules were not extended to Homoeopathy, he has the experience of Triturating medicines with his own hands. He has done all the work, including washing of bottles, before using these for the patients. Inspired by a lecture by Dr. William Gutman in the International Homoeopathic Congress 1967, in Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, he arranged to procure Acid Sulphurous, through one of his friends at Chemistry Lab of Delhi University, raising the first potency in lab there itself to avoid being turned into Acid Sulphuric after absorbing Oxygen from the environment. He prepared 6, and 30 potencies, both handmade. The interesting observation was that 6 potency was more helpful, as against 30 used by Dr. Gutman. In fact, 30 potency was much potent, and used to create dryness in the Naso-Pharynx. Over the years, as old Delhi is not much of the residential area, now acute cases are much less, and majority are the chronic ones. The trend of practice has changed over the years, due to various changes in the life styles, and the increasing number of Iatrogenic (Man made) conditions. The training at the Rehabilitation Medicine gave exposure to the supporting systems like Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and broadened the outlook towards the patients as to what best could be done to improve their quality of life. Similarly, the exposure to the seminars at Brahma Kumaris Institutions at Mount Abu taught the real meaning of Harmony. The Blessings by Swami Akhandanand Ji (of Shankaracharya Mathh, and who attained Samadhi in the year 1987), helped in understanding of our purpose in life.He takes each case without any bias, and during the case taking tries to explore the individuality. He doesn’t stick to any specific approach, and proceeds with an open mind. He tries his best to remain updated with various developments relating to our system of medicine, by being actively involved in various Conferences, Domestic, as well as International, which included his presentations as well. He is actively involved in SDHA, and organizing Kent Memorial Lectures each year. He is also actively involved with the Homoeopathic Pharmaceutical Association of India. His interest also involves around the regulatory mechanisms and the changes being made therein, and is vocal in expressing his views, for or against any changes that are being proposed from time to time, taking care the benefits for the profession in the long run, and also, he is trying his best to bring about harmony in the Industry, Trade, and the Profession. He is indebted to the professional colleagues, who have always been very cooperative, whenever approached for any issue involving our Noble profession. He respects the love, and regards bestowed to him by all the colleagues, whether in Profession, or Industry, including those who are in those working in the regulatory mechanism. He always advises his colleagues to encourage the torch bearers of our next generation, and be sincere to the profession.'
